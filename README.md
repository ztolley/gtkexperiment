# GTK 4 - Simple template

This repository is based on a simple GTK4 [tutorial](https://github.com/ToshioCP/Gtk4-tutorial/blob/main/Readme.md)
adapted for use in CLion and CMake.

The `CMakeLists.txt` file provides build configuration to compile C code and also convert `.ui` files containing screen
layouts into C code and then compile and link them with the GTK4 libraries.
